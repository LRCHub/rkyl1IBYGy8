I feel sick
In quite a few ways
Hurry, quick
I'm actin' all strange
What is this?
'Cause I'm not in pain and I don't have a temperature
So I guess it's you
I wanna smile, I wanna cry, I wanna laugh
I wanna kiss, wanna fight and then make up in the bath
And you could just stand there, and I'd be like I, I, I
I'm feelin' everything, everywhere, all at once
I feel stupid and clueless like what the fuck
You looked nice sat in my head
And I sleep with your clothes when you're not in my bed
Do anything, anywhere that you like
If you want me whenever, I'll be there in five
Did I just step in some love?
Feelin' everything, everywhere, all at once (all at once, all at once)
All at once (all at once, all at once)
All at once
You're a dick
Yeah, you put me through hell, I'm an addic-
-Ted to the way that you smell
'Cause it stays in my hair
It's like you're always there
It's so unfair, yeah
I wanna jump, I wanna scream, I wanna shout
I wanna tell you that I love you, then smash up your house
All you do is stand there, and I'm like God, I, I
I'm feelin' everything, everywhere, all at once
I feel stupid and clueless like what the fuck
You look so nice sat in my head
And I sleep with your clothes when you're not in my bed
Do anything, anywhere that you like
If you want me whenever, I'll be there in five
Did I just step in some love?
Feelin' everything, everywhere, all at once
All at once
All at once
All at once
Once, ah (all at once)
All these emotions (all at once)
Hopeless devotion (all at once)
Swim across the ocean
What have you done? (All at once)
'Cause I think I'm broken
I'm feelin' everything, everywhere, all at once
I feel stupid and clueless like what the fuck
You look so nice sat in my head
And I sleep with your clothes when you're not in my bed
Anything, anywhere that you like
If you want me whenever, I'll be there in five
Did I just step in some love?
Feelin' everything, everywhere, all at once
All at once
All at once
All at once
All at once
Once, ah
(All at once)
