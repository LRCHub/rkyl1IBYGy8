What if we went back
Think I'd see you there?
Watching planets form
I'm holding your hand
On the seventh day
We'll just lay in bed
And watch "Everything
Everywhere" again

Think if we went back
You'd have an accent
Poking fun at all
The Americans
Couple hundred years
You'll be one of them
You'll be everything
And go everywhere

Eyes like low light
Passing through time
Reflecting back
An event horizon
And every past life
Comes in colliding
All at once
And every time I'm
Next to you, next to you

What if we went back
Think I'd see you there?
